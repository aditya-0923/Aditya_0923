**Subject:** Concerning the Unjustified Workload and Poor Teaching Standards in Physical Education at C.S.H.P. Public School, Ghaziabad

**To:** \[Insert relevant CBSE email IDs here]

**Respected Sir/Madam,**

I am a student of Class 12 from C.S.H.P. Public School, Pratap Vihar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, and I write this email to highlight serious issues with the way Physical Education is being handled in our school.

This email is being written at 2:00 AM on 12 April 2025—an indication of the distress I am facing due to the inefficient handling of the subject. Despite having a Chemistry test scheduled for the morning, I was unable to devote time to prepare for it because I was occupied completing Physical Education work that holds no academic value.

We are being forced to mechanically copy content from the textbook into our notebooks under the guise of making notes. This is not only a waste of time but also contributes to unnecessary academic pressure. The material is already available in the textbook, and the practice of blindly transcribing it serves no educational purpose.

To make matters worse, the textbook being used—supplied by the school at a cost of ₹325—is riddled with major factual and conceptual errors on almost every page. Instead of aiding our learning, it misguides us and adds confusion. We feel cheated both intellectually and financially.

As if this weren’t enough, I must bring to your attention a further serious concern. A few days after the aforementioned issues, our teacher completely skipped the following key topics from Chapter 2 ("Children and Women in Sports") during her lecture:

* Menarche
* Menstrual Dysfunction
* Menopause
* Osteoporosis
* Amenorrhea

These are essential concepts, and skipping them reflects a lack of professionalism and responsibility on the part of the educator. Such gaps in teaching leave students unprepared for board exams and betray the core purpose of education.

I sincerely request the CBSE to take appropriate action to investigate and address these issues. Students deserve a meaningful, accurate, and respectful learning experience—something we are currently being denied in Physical Education.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

**Sincerely,**
\[Your Full Name]
